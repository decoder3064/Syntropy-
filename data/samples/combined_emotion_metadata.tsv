In an effort to continue to try new things as it relates to freelance work I did a gig yesterday for a show being setup in Tampa. I found that the lady that hired me treats workers as slaves, talks down to us, and doesn't appear to believe any of use had brains. I'm not certain if this was based on previous experiences or her personality, but it made for a long ten hour day and many frustrations. I never walk out on jobs, because I believe I can learn something new from every experience and try to do this with each undertaking. Tomorrow is a fresh day with new horizons to conquer, so let's see what it brings.	confusion	journal	paragraph
