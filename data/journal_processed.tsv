They brought back a lot of happy memories and some that made me feel very nostalgic and even a bit melancholy. It is so easy to remember those times with great fondness, but hard a bit when I look back and didn't realize how carefree those days were, compared to what they are now. I miss my kids when they were little and growing up and discovering new things and interests.	joy	journal	paragraph

My brother and nephew, who I don't see as much anymore, both came over to play basketball at the gym with me. My car has been down for a few weeks so I've been stuck in the house a lot lately. It felt really good to get out of the house and spend time with my family. We talked about a  lot of different things like basketball, life back in Pennsylvania, and work life. It felt like I refueled after spending time with them.	joy	journal	paragraph

Just being able to spend a day with the family all being here is great. With my oldest daughter going to college, and working, it's hard to see her as much as we used to. It's the greatest thing ever when we just get to all sit down and eat dinner together.	joy	journal	paragraph

It was just one of those days that didn't seem to really be active. The kids were at school, but came home all hyped up. Didn't want to settle to do school work, wanted to fight with one another.

It is a challenge to have the family together and have them get along.  There are many differences between the children but they do want to participate in activities together.  I think that if they could just figure out how to help each other and that they could make a good team that they will be best friends.  Sometimes they surprise me with their time together and kindness and sharing with each other.  Other times they cause a lot of excitement and frustration in trying to get them to work together.  I am happy when they all can be together and enjoy each other.	joy	journal	paragraph
It always makes me feel accomplished to see my family and how well they are doing.	joy	journal	paragraph

In an effort to continue to try new things as it relates to freelance work I did a gig yesterday for a show being setup in Tampa. I found that the lady that hired me treats workers as slaves, talks down to us, and doesn't appear to believe any of use had brains. I'm not certain if this was based on previous experiences or her personality, but it made for a long ten hour day and many frustrations. I never walk out on jobs, because I believe I can learn something new from every experience and try to do this with each undertaking. Tomorrow is a fresh day with new horizons to conquer, so let's see what it brings.	confusion	journal	paragraph

So yesterday, I spent most of my working time testing and debugging the new code I wrote to automatically log a user back in when they time out, AND run whatever command they were trying to run when the program realized they'd timed out. The login part works great! And the running the command part works too - as long as there's only ONE command. If a single action, like a click, triggers TWO commands - like for instance, if clicking anywhere in a widget selects it, and clicking a button within it also contacts the DB - then only the first one runs and I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. I can't debug it because every time I pause the code to step through it, the behavior changes! I suppose that in itself helps me narrow it down some - it must be a timing issue in some way - but I'm really stumped. I'll work on it some more today, I guess. I hate bugs I can't trace well, I feel like I don't have a good handle on how to find them. I mostly just stare at the code until inspiration strikes.	pride	journal	paragraph
I'm tired of having bad food. It's like there is nothing in the kitchen. Oatmeal was ok but to follow it up with tuna and mayo for lunch made me feel ill. Then sloppy joes for dinner? Too strange of a combination for me. Makes me angry.	anger	journal	paragraph

I worked my shift at hospice yesterday. It was, as it often is, a combination of mundane tasks and meaningful moments. There were two patients that stand out in my memory. One was a woman who was virtually non-responsive; I was glad to be able to spend a little time with her. The other was a woman who told great stories about her life and then prayed for me. I feel grateful when I leave there, and satisfied that I've connected with others.	approval	journal	paragraph

I worked all day yesterday so it was one of few things I did yesterday but I do not consider this job one of the most important jobs I've had overall. It is important to me in that it is how I support myself. I still try my hardest and am conscientious at work.	approval	journal	paragraph

I work in a dog daycare and for 10 hours I'm in a loud smelly room with dogs fighting and defecating and trying to jump on me. Yesterday it was raining so we didn't get to even go outside for a run. I was exhausted and one of the dogs peed on my shoe, and it's the only pair I have so i knew it would mean I'd have wet shoes the next day. I was so exhausted and overwhelmed when I got off I cried in my car.	nervousness	journal	paragraph
