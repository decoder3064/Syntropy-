My day yesterday was pretty average and to me average is good. I prefer things to be uneventful and nothing bad happened to me so I can't really say that it was a bad day! I feel good about the work that I did and I was satisfied with myself.	pride
What does Clemson give pride stickers for? Snaps played?	confusion
"""Seeeee! We have one of them coloureds too!"""	excitement
Yesterday was a very informative day with my son and daughter-in-law. My son told me he was starting a new semester at school and he would be enrolling on his day off Friday. My daughter-in-law was very happy yesterday and offered to bring me newspapers from work which she could get free from her boss. All in all a very pleasant day.	pride
I really like this ring so Iâ€™m glad to hear that.	joy
Yesterday I was diagnosed with cancer. I don't know how to feel, right now I just feel empty and possibly in shock. I haven't told anyone yet, but I think I will probably call my parents and sisters today to let them know. I just need time to process this alone right now.	sadness
My work yesterday involved working around the yard, mowing, trimming branches and bushes, sweeping the walk and patio and finally cleaning and refillling all of the bird feeders.  It is very enjoyable work for me.  I love being outdoors.  It's also exercise as I built up a sweat once or twice.  When I was through, it looked and felt like a good accomplishment.  The yard looks great and our curb appeal is really good.	pride
yesterday was my daughters first birthday and it was such a happy event! we opened her presents and gave her a giant cupcake to eat all to herself. Me and my family had a blast celebrating this milestone in my daughters life.	joy

Hypocritical is pot calling the kettle genocide	disgust
Shut up 15 year-old	anger
Work is rather salient because I spend the majority of my day there. Nothing particularly exciting or interesting really happened there but it was fairly busy as it usually is. Given that we're federal employees who are excepted from the furlough but not being paid to work we spent a lot of our day talking about the shut down and what if anything Trump is doing to attempt to alleviate it.	anger
Y'all really out here supporting authoritarian Venezuelan dictators huh.	confusion

My son received early admission to the college of his choice today! In addition he received a scholarship!	pride
my work is important and noticeable but extremely boring.   I would like a different job but it does pay the bills and gives me less headaches than other jobs.	disgust
Yesterday, my family and I played a bunch of board games. My husband won most of them which is not surprising in the least. We played all sorts of games including Life, Clue, Mouse Trap and more. It was relaxing and such a happy, fun filled moment.	joy

I bought the double barrel and fully upgraded it and now it's one of my favorite guns.	pride

My furnace doesn't work. It might cost around $1,500 to replace it, because it is old. I am working my behind off on Amazon Mechanical Turk and eBay to earn the money.	sadness
My family was the most salient part of my day, since most days the care of my 2 children occupies the majority of my time. They are 2 years old and 7 months and I love them, but they also require so much attention that my anxiety is higher than ever. I am often overwhelmed by the care the require, but at the same, I am so excited to see them hit developmental and social milestones.	joy
Me too! First time in a couple of years!	joy
Yesterday was my birthday and I spent it with my family which is the most important thing in my life. I felt loved and pampered as if I was the most important thing in their lives as well	joy
This just makes me feel inferior at this point.	sadness
Working being able to use my skills and knowledge for the benefit and growth of our company.	pride
shockingly close to reality.	surprise
Man.. all I know is if Iâ€™m with a girl and she whips out a condom from her FUCKING SHOE itâ€™s a no from me dog	disgust
Today I was very sick. It seems everybody I know has a cold and I thought I was above it but no. I had some orange juice and went back to bed. Not a good day.	sadness
Yesterday, I visited my parents and had dinner with them.  I hadn't seen them in a few weeks, so it was wonderful to see them and catch up on things.	joy

Yesterday, I finished two of the requirements for the semester. I felt relieved because the requirements were hindering me from writing my MA thesis. I also felt proud because I was able to do the tasks with flying colors.	pride
I don't really know how to explain because English is not my first language, I'm sorry.	sadness
Working for slave wages and getting screwed and exploied every day, seven days a week, is driving me nuts.  I hate it.  Why can there be any decent requestors who pay a living wage?	anger
My family is crazy I have a aunt that never stops I told her yesterday that am done dealing with this am done frighting with everyone over this I cant' make other people do what she wants or what is right and then my sister one is the cause of all our problems the other just cares about herself and friends but then she gose crazy if anyone say anything about the problems thst my other sister caused	sadness
Am I the only INTP here who cared about deadlines. It's how I got so good at crunch time and working last minute.	confusion
Gotta go fast! [NAME]	excitement
In an effort to continue to try new things as it relates to freelance work I did a gig yesterday for a show being setup in Tampa. I found that the lady that hired me treats workers as slaves, talks down to us, and doesn't appear to believe any of use had brains. I'm not certain if this was based on previous experiences or her personality, but it made for a long ten hour day and many frustrations. I never walk out on jobs, because I believe I can learn something new from every experience and try to do this with each undertaking. Tomorrow is a fresh day with new horizons to conquer, so let's see what it brings.	confusion
People who hate [NAME] really really hate him. Itâ€™s quite fascinating.	surprise
The most salient thing from yesterday was how we are a family (wife and 3 kids) but as of recent we have been very distant from each other so the household is cold and callous. Just last month our house was loud and boisterous, now its silent and uncomfortable.	sadness
his traps hide the fucking sun.	anger
Dark and funny, but not really nice guy. He has yet to call the dead girls whores for declining to sleep with him. 	disgust
Yesterday, I really felt the importance of my health. I went on a bit longer hike than usual and was very happy that I could do so. It really made me appreciate my health. With all the news of people dying and the tragedy of the Utah family murder in Mexico, it really made me aware of the importance of my own health and well being.	joy
Especially with the way they got rid of him... no real fanfare at all...	excitement
Be ready to Experience Canes Hockey	excitement
You need HELP!	surprise
Not knowing what it is, for one thing.	confusion
Yesterday was a bad day for diverticular disease, I couldn't eat, and I was in a lot of pain. Still, I was able to function through it, and I know that if I'm patient the pain will go away eventually. I just wish there was a more permanent solution.	sadness
yesterday work was like the good old days. There was so much to do and I barely had time to think. I like being busy and overwhlemed and work has been terribly boring and slow lately. Yesterday was a good day.	joy
For real! It was like a shining beacon in the night!	excitement
And only $300+ a night, beautiful but expensive.	surprise
