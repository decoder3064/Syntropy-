Makes me sad I'll never be with a beautiful woman.	sadness
My son's girlfriend stayed home from work today. She was acting odd all day. I could tell something was wrong but did not know what.  My husband came home from work later and he was focused on his friends at work. He didn't want to talk about the kids or anything.  I felt alone and sad.  Basically I felt invisible.	sadness
Today I had a good and easy day. Everything in the department was taken care of and no new issues came up.	pride
Youâ€™re right. My biggest pet peeve is the lights, it washes out all the colors and textures, I hate that BGs use them	disgust
Press fucken charges the moment they use your info.	anger
Something's wrong. The top post on r/conspiracy isn't completely anti-conspiracy? Wow, feels weird. /s(?)	surprise
I'm tired of having bad food. It's like there is nothing in the kitchen. Oatmeal was ok but to follow it up with tuna and mayo for lunch made me feel ill. Then sloppy joes for dinner? Too strange of a combination for me. Makes me angry.	anger
But but r/49ers said it was just bad luck!	sadness
Soooo [NAME] is f**ked	sadness
Who still unironically says SJWs? You look like an idiot saying that.	confusion
was able to meet up with my girlfriend after a week of not seeing her. I was very excited.	excitement
Yesterday I worked on a way for my family to see my private photos on Flickr without registering on the site. I found out that anonymous guests can see the photos but they can't comment. And the comments are the main reason for the photo-sharing! Very frustrating.	confusion
The [NAME] are all laughing at each other. They are divided. We need to strike them down while they are weak.	joy
Today at work I had the chance to catalog a $40k book which was a prized possession of my boss. It was just about falling apart but I was able to flip through, translate some German and get it up online for sale. My boss was pleased.	pride
Great! Can't wait :)	excitement
Sure but what are you basing that off of? If [NAME] is the best jump-ball receiver, wouldn't that make him the best red zone receiver?	confusion
Ugly truth is, if you didnt want to be stopped you wouldnt tell anyone. It will pass. Stay strong :)	confusion
